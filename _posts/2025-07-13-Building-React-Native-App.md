# Building a React Native App 

Very similar to react.js app , simple libraries , nothing much 
FEW CONCEPTS : 

## ScrollView vs Flatlist
Flatlist is useful when you want to just show a single screen on the scroll ( like reels ) it loads the item present in the list and show them as per scroll, just update the list and your can continue scrolling indefinitely , ScrollView is useful when you dont want to bifurcate between scrolls, and you want to load the whole data, for continous app screen pages like (home screen ) scrollview is useful, else for reels Flatlist is useful    

## Fonts
Take fonts from google app store , that is download the relevant font and then use it
