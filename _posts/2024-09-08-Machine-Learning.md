#### A medium level ML concepts 

Activations : 

In activation function, you might have seen we are kinda trying to avoid the negative values / trying to keep only a positive values or only negative values ..

Ex: ReLU    

What's the reason behind this and why are we ditching them?
Earlier the most common activation function used to be sigmoid and tanh but now most common ones are ReLU and its derivatives

The shift is because of the derivatives for these functions in the computation graph 

[Computation Graph](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuqing-Chen-3/publication/344260274/figure/fig3/AS:936580785139716@1600309668673/A-a-neural-network-and-b-its-computational-graph-The-c-forward-and-backward.png)

  
The range of d(tanh) lies between 0 and 1, the multiplication of too many of these values lead to way less gradient values and the weights don't get updated properly 

0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 *0.8 * 0.8 => 0.32 ( multiple's of these would lead to vanishing grads )

1) Can linear layer output more than the input that it took ?
* No that is not possible, as the weight initialisation are in rnage (-1 -- 1)

2) Why squishing/removing the negative values of the weights using the activation functions is important ?
* reason is vanishing gradients   


input -> linear -> tanh(x) -> linear -> tanh -> output 

Forward pass  
(x) -> ( wx + b ) -> (0.8) -> (wx + b) -> (0.8) -> output 

initial x=10: (10) -> (0.3*10 + 0.3 = 3.3) -> (0.8) -> (0.3 * 0.8 + 0.3 = 0.54) -> (0.4)
initial x=0.5: (0.5) -> (0.3*0.5 + 0.3           = 0.45) -> (0.3) -> (0.3 * 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.39) -> (0.25)


In the backward pass,   

Derivate: quantifies how sensitive a function is with respect to the change in its the input 

[Loss.backward()](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-does-the-backward-function-do/9944) -> computes dloss/dx for all the parameters x , which has requires_grad in the model 

dL / dWs -> dL / d(wx+b) * d(wx+b) /        dx  
(Ws : all the parameters in the model) -> and is done using the chain rule  

Optimizer:  

Changes the weights of the model (according to the policy defined ) to minimize the loss function 

W_i+1 = W_i - lr * dL / dW_i 

(The sgd is not well explained in the pytorch docs , the loop they represent is teh whole training loop , not the sgd loop)

### Forward pass Gradient explosion / vanishing
If the weights at backward pass of step t-1 rises , then the weights at forward pass of t step also rises 


### Backward pass gradient explosion / vanishign  
Weights updation happens in the backward pass



### Gradient free meta learning 
Never computes or propagates gradients.
Treats the entire weight set as a black‑box parameter vector and optimizes it with non‑gradient methods (e.g. evolutionary strategies, population‑based search).


Think of your entire set of 4‑bit quantized weights 𝑊 as a single “individual” in a population.
Each individual is just one candidate solution—a full weight assignment for the network.

You start with 𝑁 random individuals (e.g. 𝑁 = 100 ) 
and anyone of this can be a potential case for our case , we randomly start and do just a forward pass calculate loss value 

Rank from lowest loss to highest and pick up top 2 candidates (elitism) ..  
and then in loop = 2, choose random 98 more, total 2+98 = 100 more 

and then we have these possibilities to do: 

#### Mutuation : 

Introduce Small Random Changes
For each new child, randomly pick a small percentage of weight bits (e.g. 1–2 %) and flip them.
This injects fresh diversity and helps explore new regions of weight‑space.
Ensure Quantization Consistency
Since weights are 4‑bit log values, any mutation simply toggles one of those bits—no out‑of‑range values.

#### Crossover : 

Pair Up Parents
Randomly choose two parents (with or without weighting by fitness) for each crossover event.
Mix Their “Genomes”
For each weight position (4‑bit log value), flip a (virtual) coin: choose the bit from parent A or parent B.
Produce one or two children from each pair.

Reduces the loss over and over , no backward pass 


## Int vs Float 

So this is something interesting, integers are actual no. that are store in the memory , they reduce computational time , and have fixed / accurate value. 

A int32 can hold at max 2^31 - 1
This is used for accuracy and that means its used for list indexing .. 


Float on the other hand is just a `representation` of a no. 
A float32 can hold max of 2^127 and this is how they do it: 
Its its within the bits limit (2^34), its stored as it is , else if we increase this to more then its gets hashed and stored using this

```
sign 
exponent 
mantissa
```

Assume it like a hash function, computer stores the hashed value in float32 .. 
so before any operation performed on float values we need to decompose it to the actual value ( to its computational-value which can take more space for the moment ) , once calculation is done , then it again gives answer back in float so its this .. and in this to and fro conversions they are prone to errors in the accuracy  


## Batchnorm , layernorm , rmsnorm , l1 norm , l2 norm 
These techniques are used to speed up the training part / increase model training 
The reason to bring these in action is because, each time the layer (l-1)th increases the layer l also has to change the weights to actually converge before the whole model can reach convergence state and these lead to in internal covariate shift .. so to avoid this delay in convergence we apply these batchnorms for inputs where batches make more sense ( like image related stuff ) , other is , language input where the batches dont make much sense so we go with layernorm ( requires 2 passes through data) , but they also have some overhead to over come these overhead we use rmsnorm (norm that is done in a single pass )
