# Learning Hardware stuff

## Learning microcontrollers

Esp32 : One of the most popular microcontroller that is inbuilt with bluetooth and wifi card ! 
ATmega328P : Microcontroller that is used in Arduino UNO 

GPIO  : general purpose input output 

`What is a firmware ? `
Firmware is a low level control over hardware , directly written in the hardware RAM, to the memory ( embedded in metal ) kinda like a kernel that manages / controls the microcontroller  

Microcontroller is the main part of a board / circuit that has embedded cpu , memoy etc and it has pins exposed ( lets say 15 pins ) and each pin can be classified as an IO pin or as an data pin. Now we made microcontroller so small but the IO devices and other modules also need to be mounted on the PCB as the wires are etched in that PCB so lets say for wifi module to work with microcontroller we need to expose a wifi pin and then the wire etched in pcb need to be connected to the wifi module and then it can be used same goes for IO device and we have that whole board .. aka development board , microcontroller board 

The development board has pins exposed for external connections , power supply etc and the real struggle comes in making electrical connections / electronics is correct and make sure you dont blow up things by giving them extra voltage etc .. 

So the electronics parts is a bit tough part !!

## Powering the microcontroller !!

`How to power a microcontroller ? What are the appropriate voltages to supply ? and what does those pins means ? `
