# Learning D3 js 


## Simulation : 

Its like a mini physics engine, where instead of manually positioning every elements you let the simulation apply forces ( like gravity , repulsion , attraction ) to your nodes. 
f

Force Link : 

Force Many Body : Simulates repulsion between nodes 


## Smooth Transition 


## Register DOM event

Registers an event on DOM 

## Animation and tick in d3.js 

Its a part of d3-force, which uses a physics model to animate elements over time over time 
`tick` refers to each iteration of this simulation 

force simulation: it continously updates node positions based on forces ( like gravity , collision ) 
Runs in tick until stabilization or a specified limit 

If you manually modify the node position in the DOM, D3 simulation will override those values in the next tick !!
The simulation updates the values of x, y properties of each node based on forces. 

`fx` : fixed-x
`fy` : fixed-y
