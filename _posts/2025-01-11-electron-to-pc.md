# Basics 

Atom made up of electron , proton , nucleus 

conductor -> free electrons in valence shell 
insulator -> no electrons in valence shell 
semiconductor -> few electrons in valence neither a good conductor or insulator 

semiconductor in pure form is useless , dope it to make n / p type 

## Diode
Electric field: start from positive end to negative end 
electrons accelerate in the opposite direction of the field 

n-type connected with p-type to create a np-junction for unidirectional flow of current   

A depletion zone is created at junction which has around 0.7v Potential diff and to flow the current a battery of >0.7 is required else its in off state 

To open-close the connection human involvement is required ( major drawback ) 

## Transistor

N-P-N type and P-N-P type 

In npn, 
np side and pn side both want to flow current in inner sides so no outer current is flown in natural state 

when p side is connected to a insulated-positive plate electrons starts to flow from n side to the p side and in addition with an external Electric field (using an battery) the current starts to flow in the required direction.
