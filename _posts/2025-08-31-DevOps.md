## Kubernetes 
This is a manager of docker containers 

So assume it like this , we have a VM from azure , that has some specs and we now want to spin up 4 containers in it so to do this we need manager as well that handles the routing, load balance, code updates reflection ( CI/CD ) and someone that we can talk to at manager level and it gives all information about the internal working of the containers, logs etc so that role is taken cared by kubernetes (k8s) 


## Docker Container 
Create your dockerfile , then create its image and then from image create a container, so this is the same that as before only additional step is to register this container to a registry ( docker hub / private hub like gitea)  

so pull the image from that hub and use it 


## Pull from registry
This is the same process to have

Till here now we have k8s and docker container and the container that's pushed to a registry

## Starting the k8s service 

## YAML files 


## Helm deployments
This is like the app-store for apps .. 
Lets suppose you want to do the jenkins integration for your CI/CD flow how will you do that ? 

get jenkins docker image, create yaml files ( 5-6 of them , deployments, services, RBAC, configmaps, secrets, persistent volumes, etc) and then apply to k8s using `kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml` and that is a very manual process to follow.   


Rather than creating multiple yaml file for each standard app to deploy we can use helm charts that directly install and add in the add and from there we use it in rest of the app  


## Jenkins

This is a CI/ CD framework that pulls from a repo , builds docker image from there and register that image to a hub registry and tell k8s to pull the new image from there and use it 

In jenkins we upload the yaml file and create a `pipeline` that tells from where we can   that jenkin s
We need to
