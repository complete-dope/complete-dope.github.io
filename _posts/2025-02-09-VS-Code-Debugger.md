# VS Code Debugger 

The ultimate use is to understand a large project , that is important to understand and is large , manually going through all the files is a bit tough so we need to ultimately understand it using a debugger  

First change the interpreter for the python file using ctrl + shift + P  > select interpreter , that will allow you to choose an interpreter where all your libraries are downloaded !! so that swiggly lines and everything goes away , no matter what's your env setup in the terminal, the interpreter path is the something that u needs to be changed !! 


Debugger starts with debugpy file extension and listens to a port, use it from the debugger button by adding breakpoints , storing values and making shit happen .. 


If file contains an external import and we need to debug that external dependency code then we need to add breakpoints in that file and work our way form there on !
